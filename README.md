# My World 🌿

**My World** is a premium, private social media experience designed as a personal sanctuary. Unlike traditional social platforms that thrive on competition and public scrutiny, My World provides a reflective, expressive space where your thoughts are validated by a supportive, AI-driven environment.

## ✨ Core Features

- **Private Sanctuary**: All data is stored locally in your browser. No servers, no tracking, total privacy.
- **Expressive Feed**: A Twitter-inspired layout for daily thoughts, emotions, and achievements.
- **Validation Engine**: Every post receives simulated high-engagement (1.2M+ followers) and empathetic, context-aware comments generated by Gemini AI.
- **Personal Customization**: Full control over profile identity, including name, bio, avatar, and cover photos.
- **Premium UI/UX**: Clean, minimalist design with smooth animations, dark/light mode support, and a high-end mobile-first aesthetic.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (ESM via esm.sh)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-3-flash-preview`)
- **Storage**: Browser LocalStorage API

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

My World follows a **Local-First** philosophy:
- **Zero Server Footprint**: Your reflections never leave your device.
- **Security Protocol**: Data is stored in your browser's `localStorage`. Clearing site data permanently erases your sanctuary.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Since this project uses ES Modules, you can serve it using any static web server:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set your environment variable: `API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY`.
3. Open `index.html` via a local server (e.g., `npx serve .`).
